| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [SEP-2640 (Skills Extension)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2640) | MCP Spec | This WG's proposed extension: skills served over MCP using the Resources primitive and `skill://` URI scheme ([v1 baseline text](sep-draft-skills-extension.md)) |
| [PR #2527](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2527) | MCP Spec | Recommend clients expose resource read to models — prerequisite for the resources-based skills approach |
| [skills.json format proposal](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/discussions/895) | MCP Registry | Skills metadata in registry schema |
| ~~[SEP-2093](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2093)~~ | MCP Spec | ~~Resource Contents Metadata and Capabilities: scoped `resources/list`, per-resource capabilities, `resources/metadata` endpoint~~ — **rejected** ([labeled upstream](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2093)) |
| ~~[SEP-2076](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2076)~~ | MCP Spec | ~~Agent Skills as a first-class MCP primitive~~ — **closed** (2026-02-24, without merge) |

> See also [**skills-extension-candidates.md**](skills-extension-candidates.md) for a tracker of MCP servers, dev tools, SDKs, and skills repositories that are candidates for adopting the skills extension.

## Working Group Member Implementations

Work by WG leads and active participants that directly implements the group's core patterns: SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter, `skill://` resource URIs, and progressive disclosure via MCP primitives.

| Implementation | Author | URL | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| skilljack-mcp | Ola Hungerford | [github.com/olaservo/skilljack-mcp](https://github.com/olaservo/skilljack-mcp) | SKILL.md, `skill://` resources, tools, and prompts; progressive disclosure (index→skill→files); file watching for dynamic updates; audience annotations |
| skills-over-mcp | Keith Groves | [github.com/keithagroves/skills-over-mcp](https://github.com/keithagroves/skills-over-mcp) | SKILL.md, `skill://` resources with progressive disclosure (index→skill→documents); Zod validation against Agent Skills spec |
| skillsdotnet | Peder HP | [github.com/PederHP/skillsdotnet](https://github.com/PederHP/skillsdotnet) | C# implementation: SKILL.md, `skill://` resources, `load_skill` tool for progressive disclosure, manifest with file hashes; published on NuGet; compatible with FastMCP 3.0 |

## Alternative Approaches

Work by WG members and MCP maintainers that explores skills over MCP through different technical approaches than the core SKILL.md / `skill://` pattern.

| Implementation | Author | Organization | URL | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| skillful-mcp | Kurtis Van Gent | Google Cloud | [github.com/kurtisvg/skillful-mcp](https://github.com/kurtisvg/skillful-mcp) | Progressive disclosure via 4 lightweight tools (`list_skills`, `use_skill`, `read_resource`, `execute_code`); wraps downstream MCP servers as skills using `mcp.json` config rather than SKILL.md; sandboxed code execution via Monty |
| Astronomer agents | Kaxil Naik | Astronomer | [github.com/astronomer/agents](https://github.com/astronomer/agents) | Production skills catalog for Apache Airflow (blueprint, migration, warehouse-init); uses SKILL.md frontmatter but distributed via plugin marketplace rather than MCP resources; demonstrates real-world skills adoption at scale |
| mcpGraph skill | Bob Dickinson | TeamSpark.ai | [github.com/TeamSparkAI/mcpGraph](https://github.com/TeamSparkAI/mcpGraph) | Declarative YAML-based tool orchestration engine (directed graphs of MCP tool calls); includes SKILL.md files as documentation; explores a complementary "no-code composition" approach to skill authoring |

## Specifications and Standards

- **Agent Skills Standard:** [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/)
- **Agent Skills Discovery RFC v0.2.0** (Matt Silverlock / Cloudflare): [github.com/cloudflare/agent-skills-discovery-rfc](https://github.com/cloudflare/agent-skills-discovery-rfc) — Domain-level skill discovery using `/.well-known/agent-skills/` (RFC 8615). Defines `index.json` with progressive disclosure, `skill-md` and `archive` distribution types, `$schema` versioning, SHA-256 content integrity, and archive safety requirements. Complementary to MCP-level discovery: `.well-known` answers "what skills does this domain publish?" while MCP answers "how does the agent consume them at runtime?"
- **Skill dependency declaration:** [agentskills/agentskills#110](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/issues/110) — Discusses how skills should declare their tool/server dependencies
- **Apache Airflow AIP-91** (MCP integration): [cwiki.apache.org/…/AIP-91+-+MCP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-91+-+MCP)

## Integrity, Content Addressing, and Attestation

Related work on establishing and verifying the integrity, authenticity, and provenance of skill resources.
  
- **skill-set format (draft)** (Harry Martin / flocker.md): [skill-set.md](https://skill-set.md/) — Transport-agnostic manifest specification and CLI for named, versioned collections of skills assembled from disparate sources. Defines deterministic whole-skill content hashes and set-level roll-ups, lockfiles, receipt-time content verification, and optional out-of-band URL-fragment pins. Complementary to SEP-2640: provides prior art for deriving a single content address from a complete `{uri, digest}` resource set and for future whole-skill or multi-skill attestations. See the [reference directory](https://skill-sets.md/sets/skill-authoring/) for an immutable example.

Grounded in lessons from GitHub's MCP Server (100+ tools, 12M weekly calls)
