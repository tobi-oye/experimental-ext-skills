### 2026-02-14: Skills served over MCP use the instructor format

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The inaugural meeting surfaced a key distinction between two models: skills-as-instructors (structured markdown content served to agents) and skills-as-helpers (scripts/code that execute locally). The group needed to decide which model to prioritize for skills served over MCP. Subsequent discussion in Discord and the Feb 26 office hours broadened the scope beyond "teaching agents to use tools" specifically.

**Decision:** Skills served over MCP use the instructor format (structured markdown content), with the convention being agnostic about whether skills reference server tools, external tools, or general knowledge. The helper model (executing arbitrary local code) is out of scope for MCP-served skills.

**Rationale:** Helper-style skills that require local code execution already have existing distribution mechanisms (repos, npx, etc.) and don't need MCP as a transport. Instructor-style skills are more portable across remote and local MCP servers, easier to security-vet (static instructional content vs. arbitrary code), and align better with MCP's role as a context protocol. Dynamically served code-execution skills were flagged as unlikely to pass security review for registry listing.

### 2026-02-14: Keep docs as markdown in-repo rather than publish as a website

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The question arose whether the IG should publish docs using a solution like Mintlify or keep them as markdown files in the repository.

**Decision:** Keep documentation as markdown files in the repository.

**Rationale:** The markdown-in-repo approach is working well for the IG's current needs. It keeps the contribution barrier low (just edit markdown and submit a PR), avoids introducing additional tooling and infrastructure, and is sufficient for the group's size and documentation complexity. Can be revisited if the group grows or docs become harder to navigate.

### 2026-02-14: Reference external implementations rather than fork them

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The group needed to decide whether to bring external implementations (reference repos, SEPs, related projects) into this repository or link to them externally.

**Decision:** Document results from implementations in `experimental-findings.md` and link to external repos and resources in `related-work.md`, rather than forking or vendoring external code.

**Rationale:** This avoids duplication and maintenance burden, keeps the repo focused on the IG's exploratory documentation, and lets external projects evolve independently. The pattern of findings + references is working well for the group's needs.

### 2026-02-21: Coordinate with Agent Skills spec via their Discussions

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The IG needed a communication channel with the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/) maintainers to align on proposals, share findings, and avoid divergence. The spec repo initially had no contributing guide.

**Decision:** Use [Discussions in the agentskills/agentskills repo](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/discussions) as the primary channel for topics that intersect both groups.

**Rationale:** The Agent Skills spec maintainers established a [contributing guide](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) directing public discussion to their Discussions area. Using their preferred channel respects their governance model and provides a single, visible place for cross-project coordination rather than fragmenting discussion across Discord, GitHub Issues, and other venues.

### 2026-02-21: Add skills-as-resources as an explored approach

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Community input (via [Issue #14](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/experimental-ext-skills/issues/14)) argued that MCP Resources are a natural fit for serving skill content, and that adding a new primitive when an existing one could work would add unnecessary complexity to the ecosystem.

**Decision:** Incorporate skills-as-resources as an explicit approach in the IG's exploration, updating Approach 3 from "Skills as Tools" to "Skills as Tools and/or Resources" and adding design principles around minimizing ecosystem complexity.

**Rationale:** Resources already have URI-based addressability, existing tooling for fetching, and a subscription model for updates. Using existing primitives rather than introducing new ones reduces ecosystem complexity -- a concern the community has vocally raised. The `skill://` URI scheme also gives skills a natural way to reference each other.

### 2026-02-26: Prioritize skills-as-resources with client helper tools

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The Feb 26 office hours discussed the skills-as-resources reference implementation ([PR #16](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/experimental-ext-skills/pull/16)) and whether the group should focus on workarounds for today's clients or the ideal client-supported approach.

**Decision:** Focus on the skills-as-resources approach using client helper tools (e.g., a built-in `read_resource` tool on the client side and an SDK-level `list_skill_uris()` method). Workaround implementations (e.g., skills in tool descriptions) remain in the repo as comparison baselines but are clearly separated in intent.

**Rationale:** Rather than having each server ship its own `load_skill` tool, clients should support model-driven resource loading directly. This is a relatively small lift for clients (compared to features like elicitation or sampling) and avoids duplicate approaches across servers. Experimental SDK changes will allow clients and models to load skill resources more consistently, which could also unlock other Resource use cases beyond skills. The plan is to partner with client implementors to test once the extension is ready.

### 2026-03-16: `_meta` is for MCP-transport-specific concerns, not skill-level semantics

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** [PR #60](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/experimental-ext-skills/pull/60) initially proposed recommended `_meta` keys that mapped Agent Skills frontmatter fields (version, invocation, allowed-tools) into MCP resource `_meta` as a "materialized view." Review feedback raised several concerns: this duplicates what frontmatter already expresses, the optimization of avoiding content fetches is premature (clients cache locally), and adding it now is harder to remove later. Further discussion identified that even MCP-specific candidates like provenance and dependencies may be better addressed at the plugin/distribution layer.

**Decision:** `_meta` on skill resources is reserved for metadata that is specific to the MCP transport context and has no natural home in frontmatter, `annotations`, Resource fields, or the distribution layer. Skill-level semantics (version, invocation mode, allowed tools, compatibility) remain in frontmatter. The `io.modelcontextprotocol.skills/` namespace is established for any future standardized keys. No specific keys are recommended at this time.

**Rationale:** The general razor is: "does this metadata also apply to non-MCP skills? If so, it should go in frontmatter." This avoids fragmenting skill metadata across transport mechanisms, keeps `_meta` lightweight for clients that optimize for lean metadata reads, and defers standardization of specific keys until there is clear implementation experience showing that frontmatter and the distribution layer are insufficient.

### 2026-04-16: URI scheme conventions for skills as resources

**Status:** Superseded in part — three of the bullets below were changed in SEP-2640 v1: enumeration moved from a `skill://index.json` resource to a `skills/list` method, the no-nesting constraint was reversed (nested skills are permitted, gated on fresh activation consent), and `skill://` was made non-privileged rather than the marker of what counts as a skill. See the 2026-07-16 v1 scope entry below, items 2, 6, and 8. The URI structure itself carries forward unchanged: explicit `SKILL.md`, final path segment equal to the skill `name`, optional organizational prefix, authority segment without special semantics.

**Context:** Several independent MCP implementations (FastMCP 3.0, NimbleBrain, skilljack-mcp, skills-over-mcp, etc.) had converged on using Resources to represent skills using either `skill://` or domain-specific URI schemes, but diverged on the rest of the URI structure. This included variations around whether to use an authority segment, whether `SKILL.md` is explicit in the URI, how to address sub-resources, and how the URI path relates to the skill's frontmatter `name`. A survey of these patterns was published in [`skill-uri-scheme.md`](skill-uri-scheme.md) and informed the draft [Skills Extension SEP (#69)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/experimental-ext-skills/pull/69). The path↔name relationship went through two drafts before settling: the first required a single path segment equal to the `name`, which broke for servers needing hierarchy (e.g., `acme/billing/refunds` vs. `acme/support/refunds`); a second draft fully decoupled path from `name`, which was too loose — a URI like `skill://a/b/c/SKILL.md` revealed nothing about what the skill was called without a frontmatter round trip.

**Decision:** Adopt `skill://<skill-path>/SKILL.md` as the recommended URI convention for skill resources over MCP, with:

- The first path segment occupies the authority position by RFC 3986 mechanics but carries no special semantics — clients MUST NOT resolve it as a network host.
- `SKILL.md` MUST be explicit in the URI, mirroring the Agent Skills spec's directory model.
- `<skill-path>` is one or more `/`-separated segments. Its **final segment MUST equal the skill's `name`** as declared in `SKILL.md` frontmatter (matching the Agent Skills spec's requirement that `name` match the parent directory). Preceding segments, if any, are a server-chosen organizational prefix (by domain, team, version, or any other axis).
- No-nesting constraint: a `SKILL.md` MUST NOT appear in any descendant directory of a skill.
- Sub-resources are addressed by path relative to the skill directory (e.g., `skill://<skill-path>/references/GUIDE.md`).
- Servers MAY serve skills under a domain-specific URI scheme (e.g., `github://owner/repo/skills/refunds/SKILL.md`) instead of `skill://`, provided each such skill is listed in the server's `skill://index.json`. The structural constraints above apply regardless of scheme.
- Servers SHOULD expose a well-known `skill://index.json` resource enumerating the skills they serve (following the [Agent Skills well-known URI index](https://agentskills.io/well-known-uri) format), but MAY decline or expose only a partial index when the catalog is large, generated on demand, or otherwise unenumerable; hosts MUST NOT treat an absent or empty index as proof a server has no skills. The index MAY include parameterized template entries for servers that also register matching MCP resource templates (a user-facing discovery mechanism via the completion API).
- Versioning in URIs is deferred and implicitly tied to server version.

**Rationale:** `skill://` convergence across independent implementations is a strong signal worth codifying. Keeping `SKILL.md` explicit preserves alignment with the Agent Skills spec's directory model. Constraining the final path segment to equal `name` — while allowing a prefix — is the key settlement: it enables hierarchical organization (fixing the single-segment rule's collision problem) while keeping the skill's identity readable from the URI alone (fixing the fully-decoupled draft's opacity problem). Allowing domain-specific schemes accommodates servers whose natural URI space already carries organizational meaning, without forcing a rewrite into `skill://`. Making enumeration optional accommodates servers with large, generated, or unenumerable skill catalogs. The decision was discussed in office hours and async in Discord and held open as [PR #70](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/experimental-ext-skills/pull/70) from 2026-03-18 through 2026-04-16.

### 2026-04-16: Convert Skills Over MCP from Interest Group to Working Group

**Status:** [Accepted by Core Maintainers](https://discord.com/channels/1358869848138059966/1464745826629976084/1494774410891231352)

**Context:** The group formed as an Interest Group on 2026-02-01 to explore skills distribution over MCP. Over the following weeks the work moved beyond problem-framing into concrete deliverables including the Skills Extension SEP (Extensions Track). Per MCP [group governance](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/working-interest-groups), Interest Groups focus on "identifying problems worth solving" and produce non-binding recommendations, while Working Groups "collaborate on a SEP, a series of related SEPs, or an officially endorsed project" and make binding decisions. The group's output had crossed that boundary.

**Decision:** Convert to a Working Group. The group retains its existing scope (skills discovery, distribution, and consumption through MCP) and charter location, now governed by WG rules: lazy consensus → formal vote → escalation, with WG Leads holding autonomous authority over meeting logistics, proposal prioritization, and in-scope SEP triage. Spec changes require WG consensus plus Core Maintainer approval.

**Rationale:** The group was already doing WG work — shepherding SEPs, building reference implementations, and coordinating cross-WG concerns — without the matching authority structure. Aligning form with function lets the group own SEP decisions in its scope (rather than routing recommendations through other WGs), formalizes the two-Lead model already in practice, and makes responsibilities explicit under the governance doc.

### 2026-04-19: Filesystem is a host-side implementation detail

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Previous meetings surfaced an open question: whether the Skills Extension SEP should require, forbid, or remain silent on a local filesystem as a host capability. The SEP as drafted is de facto filesystem-agnostic (resources are URI-addressable, `read_resource` is the recommended loading path) but does not state this as a normative requirement, leaving skill authors without a portability guarantee and hosts without clear scope.

**Decision:** The Skills Extension SEP treats the filesystem as a host-side implementation detail. Specifically:

- A skill served over MCP MUST function correctly on hosts that have no access to a local filesystem. Skill content, supporting files, and relative-path resolution MUST be expressible entirely through MCP resource operations.
- Hosts MAY materialize skill resources into a local filesystem as a performance or compatibility optimization.
- Regardless of materialization strategy, relative-path resolution within a skill MUST produce the same result as URI-based resolution. A skill that references `references/guide.md` from its `SKILL.md` resolves to the same content whether the host loads it from disk or from `resources/read` on the originating server.

**Rationale:** The value of filesystem-agnosticism is a consumer-side guarantee: a skill author writes one skill and knows it will run on any conformant host, from a cloud-code CLI with disk access to a stateless remote agent. Requiring MCP-served skills to work without a filesystem preserves this guarantee. Permitting host-side materialization preserves the use cases Peter flagged on March 24 (local server example from Jake, performance optimization for large skills, filesystem-native tooling integration). Requiring unified resolution semantics closes the gap that would otherwise make materialization a behavior-divergence source. The SEP's "Hosts: Unified Treatment" section already aspires to this at SHOULD level; this ADR promotes the semantic requirement to MUST while keeping the implementation a host choice.

### 2026-04-19: Archives permitted as server-side packaging optimization

**Status:** Superseded — archives were removed from SEP-2640 in core-maintainer review; see the 2026-07-16 v1 scope entry below

**Context:** On 2026-03-24, a commit to the Skills Extension SEP (PR #69, [`9e73838c`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/experimental-ext-skills/pull/69/commits/9e73838cda478f3bba4996a06a69d3142fb0a91c)) removed `type: "archive"` from the `skill://index.json` schema with the rationale that archives do not apply when files are individually addressable. On further review, there are four costs not addressed in the original commit: asymmetry with the Agent Skills discovery RFC, which defines both `skill-md` and `archive` distribution types; loss of atomicity across multi-file skill reads; N+1 round trips for hosts that pre-materialize skills; and loss of UNIX file metadata (executable bits, symlinks) that has no representation when each file is served as an individual MCP resource.

**Decision:** Permit `type: "archive"` entries in `skill://index.json`, matching the Agent Skills discovery RFC. An archive entry's `url` points to a single resource (mime type `application/zip` or `application/x-tar`) whose content unpacks into the skill's URI namespace at `skill://<skill-path>/<file-path>`. Servers choose per-skill between individual-file and archive distribution; hosts observe an identical virtual namespace either way.

**Rationale:** The SEP is positioned as a pure transport binding that delegates format to the Agent Skills specification. Dropping a distribution type the format spec defines contradicts that framing. Reinstating archives as a server-side packaging option — rather than a client-visible mode split — preserves the "skills as virtual filesystem" model (post-unpack view is identical to individual-file distribution) while recovering atomicity and round-trip properties. The main property lost is per-file subscription granularity, which is acceptable because subscription is not currently part of the skill reading model in the SEP.

### 2026-06-02: Reinstate the `digest` field in `skill://index.json`

**Status:** Superseded — the single per-entry digest was replaced by a per-file `resources` manifest; see the 2026-07-16 v1 scope entry below

**Context:** SEP-2640's `skill://index.json` binding follows the [Agent Skills well-known discovery index](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/pull/254) with two stated differences — the `url` field carries a full MCP resource URI, and the per-entry `digest` field is omitted "(integrity is the transport's concern over an authenticated MCP connection)" — plus one MCP-specific addition, the `mcp-resource-template` `type` value. In the upstream index each skill entry carries a `digest` (a `sha256:<hex>` content hash) serving two purposes: (1) integrity — letting an index host attest that a served skill matches what the index advertised, which matters when the index and the skill artifacts live on different hosts (e.g., index on one domain, archives on a CDN); and (2) caching — a client stores the digest, refetches only the index, and skips refetching unchanged skill content, which can run to tens of MB. The same trade-off was argued upstream on [agentskills#254](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/pull/254), where Peter Alexander questioned the digest's value over HTTP (standard HTTP caching could cover it) and Jonathan Hefner defended it on cross-domain integrity and lockstep-consistency grounds. Over MCP, purpose (1) does not apply, since the same server serves both the index and the skill resources; and the cleaner long-term answer to (2) — a general resource-freshness mechanism (resource metadata or ETags) — does not exist in the base protocol today. The omission was revisited in the June 2, 2026 Working Session and in the [#skills-over-mcp-wg](https://discord.com/channels/1358869848138059966/1464745826629976084) Discord channel, where the group converged on putting `digest` back.

**Decision:** Reinstate the per-entry `digest` field in `skill://index.json`, matching the upstream Agent Skills discovery index (a `sha256:<hex>` content hash). The SEP's index-format description and field table are updated to add `skills[].digest`. With this change, the binding's only remaining divergences from the upstream index format are the `url` field's MCP-resource-URI semantics and the MCP-specific `mcp-resource-template` `type` value; `digest` and `archive` both align with upstream.

**Rationale:** Caching is the practical driver. Absent a resource-level freshness mechanism in the current spec, the index digest is the client's primary signal for whether cached skill content is still current; skill payloads are large enough that blindly refetching on every index poll is wasteful. Notably, the caching argument that was marginal over HTTP — where we resisted the digest because standard HTTP caching already exists — is the one that carries the decision over MCP, precisely because MCP has no equivalent caching layer or `resources/metadata`/ETag facility yet. The digest may become redundant once the protocol grows such a facility, at which point this binding can defer to it; but omitting it now leaves clients with no freshness signal within the reading model this SEP defines, a near-term cost too large to accept for the sake of avoiding an eventual redundancy. A secondary benefit raised in discussion is tamper and drift detection: a client can compare the advertised digest against cached content and warn the user when a skill has changed — including the case where an agent has modified skill content locally — for example on a `/skills list` view. A further consideration, raised by Jonathan Hefner in both the upstream thread and the June 2 session, is consistency across interdependent skills: when a client reads the index and then fetches several skills in sequence, a digest lets it detect content shifting underneath it mid-fetch and retry. The original integrity argument for *omitting* the field still holds — integrity is not the digest's job over a single authenticated connection — but integrity was never the reason to *include* it; caching is. Finally, reinstating the field realigns the binding with the upstream discovery format, consistent with the SEP's framing as a transport binding that delegates format to agentskills.io — the same principle the SEP already invokes to permit `archive` distribution (see the related decision below).

### 2026-06-05: Decouple the index schema from `.well-known`; keep it a file with verbatim frontmatter and per-skill archives

**Status:** Superseded — the index file was replaced by a `skills/list` method and the `archives` array was removed; verbatim frontmatter carries forward; see the 2026-07-16 v1 scope entry below

**Context:** SEP-2640's index was originally specified as the [Agent Skills `.well-known` discovery index](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/pull/254) with a few MCP-specific differences (see 2026-06-02), so that a client consuming the HTTP `.well-known` index could consume `skill://index.json` with the same code. Peter Alexander reported being unable to confirm that the upstream `.well-known` agent-skills discovery spec will land: it has implementations in the wild but no governance momentum into the agentskills.io spec itself. Binding the SEP's index to a stalled upstream blocks progress, so the thread converged on defining the WG's own schema.

**Decision:**

- **Decouple the index schema from the `.well-known` discovery format.** The WG defines its own `skill://index.json` schema rather than mirroring upstream; alignment with `.well-known` is no longer a design constraint.
- **Keep the index as a file resource; do not elevate to a `skills/list` protocol method.** Elevation was considered — the principal motivation for a file had been matching `.well-known`, now removed — and set aside.
- **Each skill entry carries `url`, `digest`, a `frontmatter` object, and an `archives` array:**
  - `frontmatter` is a *full, verbatim copy* of the skill's `SKILL.md` frontmatter. The schema designates no specific fields and neither includes nor excludes any — it is the whole block.
  - `archives` is a list of `{ url, mediaType, digest }`, each describing one archive representation of the skill (e.g. `application/gzip`, `application/zip`).
- **Archives move from separate `type: "archive"` index entries (see 2026-04-19) to the per-skill `archives` array.** This amends the representation in that decision; archives remain a server-side packaging option, now expressed as a property of the skill rather than a sibling entry.

**Rationale:**

- *Decoupling.* The upstream `.well-known` format has real implementations but is not progressing through agentskills.io governance, and the SEP cannot wait on it; owning the schema unblocks the WG. The cost is divergence from a format that has consumers, so the schema should stay close enough to re-converge if upstream revives — but the hard dependency is removed. This retires the "mirror/realign with upstream" rationale that the 2026-04-19 (archives) and 2026-06-02 (digest) decisions invoked. Both still stand on their own merits — archives for dual-format distribution, digest for caching and cross-fetch consistency — but neither is justified by upstream alignment any longer.
- *File over method.* A `skills/list` method would make "skill" a named concept in the protocol, which conflicts with the skills-as-files philosophy of the SEP and of skills themselves. The capabilities a method would add — enumeration, pagination, change notification — are already available from resource improvements (a directory-style listing and `resources/list_changed`), so a method adds primitive surface without a matching gain. Keeping a file also leaves the index free to advertise non-skill entry types (e.g. primitive groups) as a progressive-discovery entry point later; that flexibility is a side effect of decoupling, explicitly not an in-scope expansion here.
- *Verbatim frontmatter.* `name` and `description` live in the frontmatter per the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification#frontmatter); promoting them to top-level entry properties would require special-case logic to avoid duplicating them and would invite recurring debate over which fields belong in the index. Copying the full frontmatter block verbatim avoids both, keeps the index's skill semantics pinned to the agent-skills spec (no drift), and automatically covers client-side compatibility filtering (raised by Bloomberg): `compatibility`, `metadata`, and any other fields arrive by definition rather than being individually whitelisted.
- *Archives as a per-skill array.* Expressing archives as a property of the skill, rather than as separate entries, resolves the "archive + `SKILL.md` simultaneously" item without duplicating `name`/`description`/frontmatter across two entries, and lets a server offer several formats, each with its own `mediaType` and `digest`. Per-archive `digest` mirrors the entry-level digest's caching/consistency role for each packaged form.

### 2026-06-09: Directory enumeration via a dedicated `resources/directory/read` method

**Status:** Proposed — amended 2026-07-16: retained in SEP-2640 v1 as an optional feature gated behind the `directoryRead` capability setting

**Context:** A skill is a directory of files, and hosts that materialize a skill (or otherwise walk its contents) need to enumerate the files under a skill root without already knowing every URI. An earlier SEP draft did this with a scoped `resources/list(uri="skill://…")` call, but the base MCP spec does not guarantee scoped `resources/list`, leaving this extension with a protocol dependency it could not rely on (the SEP's "Why an Index Resource Rather Than `resources/list`?" section records the move away from that approach). The 2026-06-02 Working Session listed "try to get `resources/list(uri)` into the protocol" as an action item; the MCP core maintainer (dsp) was on board, leaving the WG to spec the mechanism. The design was worked out over the following week in the SEP feedback thread and landed in [SEP-2640](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2640) on 2026-06-09.

**Decision:** Add a dedicated `resources/directory/read` method to the protocol for listing the children of a directory-like resource:

- Directories are identified by `mimeType` `inode/directory`.
- `resources/directory/read(uri)` returns a **paginated list of `Resource`** — the same response shape as `resources/list` (cursor-based pagination included). It returns **metadata only** (each child's `uri`, `name`, `title`, `mimeType`, etc.), **not** the contents of the children — equivalent to `ls`, not a recursive read.
- Calling `resources/directory/read` on a non-directory resource is an error.
- The method name is plural-`resources/`, consistent with the existing `resources/read` and `resources/list` (an earlier `resource/directory/read` spelling was a typo).
- This is introduced as a skills-extension-scoped capability for now; if it works well, the WG expects to promote it to core MCP and may add further directory verbs in a later spec version.

**Rationale:** The WG considered three options and rejected the two that overload existing verbs:

1. *Make `resources/read` return a child listing when the target is a directory.* Rejected: it would give `resources/read` a result schema that varies by `mimeType`, which risks breaking backward compatibility for clients already calling `resources/read` on URIs that are now classified as directories.
2. *Give `resources/list` an optional `uri`/subpath parameter.* This was the least-effort option for clients (Sam Kothari's preference) and was seriously weighed. Rejected: `resources/list` with and without a `uri` would carry different semantics — with no argument it returns *everything* the server exposes, which is a confusing thing to overload a scoping parameter onto. A dedicated verb keeps each method's contract single-meaning.
3. *A new `resources/directory/read` verb* (chosen): a distinct method with a stable, single result schema (reusing the `resources/list` response type, so no new shape to learn), a clear error on misuse, and no change to the semantics of any existing call. Peter Alexander proposed and specced this form (coordinating the protocol change with MCP core); Sam Kothari confirmed it solves the materialization/enumeration use case ("sgtm") and had no objection to the dedicated verb once the overloading trade-offs were laid out.

Returning metadata-only (URIs + descriptive fields, no contents) keeps the call cheap and `ls`-like, letting a host walk a skill tree and decide what to fetch via `resources/read`, rather than forcing the server to inline potentially large file contents. Tying directory-ness to the standard `inode/directory` `mimeType` reuses an existing convention instead of inventing a flag.

### 2026-07-15: Add `skills/get` for single-skill entry retrieval

**Status:** Proposed

**Context:** 

SEP-2640's `skills/list` may return an empty or partial listing by design — catalogs that are large, gateway-fronted, or generated on demand are unenumerable — and the extension's baseline hands hosts skill URIs that never appeared in any listing (from server instructions, another skill, or the user). 

Before `skills/get`, such a skill could be *read* but not *verified*: its entry — frontmatter and per-file digests — existed nowhere reachable, so it could not be content-bound to a user approval even when the underlying content was static and its digests perfectly publishable. Separately, when a single skill's content changed (surfacing as a digest-verification failure, or a user-requested update), the only way to obtain its new digests was to re-enumerate the entire catalog — thousands of entries to learn the new state of one skill. 

Aditya (@aditya-scio) raised the gap in [SEP-2640 review](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2640#discussion_r3576942360) on 2026-07-14: *"Given a server may return partial listing; I think we should also introduce a `skills/get` so that we can get the resource's manifest (so that the digest can be verified) for a given skill. Otherwise there's no way to fetch it."*

**Decision:** Add a required `skills/get` method to the extension. `skills/get(uri)` — where `uri` names a skill's `SKILL.md` — returns that skill's entry, identical in shape and meaning to a `skills/list` entry (`uri`, `frontmatter`, `resources`), under the same rules:

- Every server declaring `io.modelcontextprotocol/skills` MUST implement `skills/get`, alongside `skills/list`.
- A server MUST answer for every skill it serves, whether or not that skill appears in its `skills/list` result; it answers with an error for URIs it does not serve as skills.
- Dynamically generated skills omit `resources` in a `skills/get` response exactly as they would in a listing, and remain unverifiable by construction.

**Rationale:** The method makes verification independent of the discovery path: a URI alone was already enough to *read* a skill, and `skills/get` turns that same URI into the skill's metadata and digests, so an unlisted skill can be verified, content-bound, and approved on the same terms as a listed one. It makes change pickup proportional to what changed: one entry fetch instead of a full re-enumeration. It also doubles as the skill-identity confirmation the non-privileged-scheme rule needs — a host confirms that an explicitly referenced URI is a skill by asking the server (which answers for skills it serves and errors otherwise), never by inspecting the URI scheme. And because the returned `skill` object reuses the listing entry shape, the method adds no new schema.

### 2026-07-16: Scope SEP-2640 down to a v1: required `skills/list` + `skills/get`, per-file digests, no archives

**Status:** Proposed

**Context:** At the [June 24, 2026 core-maintainer meeting](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/discussions/2976) the vote on SEP-2640 was deferred with structural concerns: archive delivery was the main sticking point (unpacking complexity and risk, and giving up the governance advantages MCP provides), `skill://index.json` was flagged as a proprietary format outside the official skill spec that complicates permissions and TTL handling, and the proposal was seen as conflating "serve skills over MCP" with a general distribution mechanism, with script-execution risk in the background. The [June 30, 2026 WG session](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/discussions/2994) resolved to scope the extension down to the minimal shape the core maintainers would accept — per the lead maintainer's guidance, break it into something small, land it, and layer complexity afterward — deferring archives and resolving the smaller open items (index transport, name conflicts). A [core-maintainer alignment document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1llJ667kyIu5ZA_-A8U1AntWUxMW65iXaLT-3elfi3J4/edit) was reviewed with the CMs in early July, and the rework landed on the SEP branch as a commit series between July 8 and July 15, 2026. This entry consolidates that v1 shape into a single record for WG review.

**Decision:** SEP-2640 v1 comprises the following changes to the full draft:

1. **Archives removed** ([`af08f6f`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2640/commits/af08f6fe16675351433e7803a5fee3cdd1eb1d9a)). Archive distribution moves to an "Appendix: Deferred Features" that records the CM objections — host-side unpacking is an attack surface disproportionate to the benefit (decompression bombs, path traversal, link escapes, normalization collisions, non-regular entries), and two ways to serve one skill is a compatibility hazard that breaks the flat compatibility floor — so any future reintroduction starts from those objections rather than rediscovering them. A skill is always retrieved as individually addressable resources. Supersedes the 2026-04-19 archives decision and the `archives` array of 2026-06-05.
2. **`skill://index.json` replaced by a `skills/list` method** ([`9b9d299`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2640/commits/9b9d299a49102b44e68e751a7986a0d54baa7ff6)). Same entry schema, different carrier: pagination via the standard `cursor`/`nextCursor` contract, cache-lifetime semantics inherited from [SEP-2549](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/seps/2549-TTL-for-list-results) (directly answering the June 24 TTL/permissions concern), discoverability implied by the extension declaration itself, and uniformity with `tools/list`/`resources/list` client machinery. The listing MAY be empty or partial; hosts MUST NOT treat that as proof a server has no skills. Supersedes the "keep it a file" half of 2026-06-05; the verbatim-frontmatter entry shape carries forward unchanged.
3. **Single skill digest replaced by a per-file `resources` manifest** ([`cff984c`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2640/commits/cff984c3f526d34e06a758e9b4ac8fb5f5aa964d)). Each entry enumerates every file of the skill as `{uri, digest}` pairs; when present the set MUST be complete; user approval content-binds to the whole set; a read of an unlisted file within the skill is a verification failure; dynamically generated skills omit `resources` and accept that hosts may decline them. This closes a gap the CMs asked the WG to resolve — supporting files (references, templates, scripts) carried no digest, so a scanner could vet a `SKILL.md` while its supporting files changed underneath — and, per Peter Alexander's framing in the design thread, gives clients "some atomic unit of things-users-consent-to" while avoiding torn reads on individual resource changes, recovering the atomic-snapshot property archives offered without the unpacking surface. Supersedes the 2026-06-02 single-digest decision.
4. **`skills/get` added for single-skill entry retrieval** ([`d7490ec`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2640/commits/d7490ecd1a250f7bc8c3ebb0d65450dfec274bad)) — recorded separately in the 2026-07-15 entry above.
5. **`resources/directory/read` retained but optional**, gated behind a `directoryRead` capability setting (default `false`); clients MUST NOT call it against a server that has not declared it. Amends the 2026-06-09 decision, which introduced the method unconditionally.
6. **Skill URI schemes are non-privileged** ([`2971db7`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2640/commits/2971db76fe113d486a1dff4ae0b068ab53e89d94)). `skill://` is conventional, not semantic: a host learns that a resource is a skill from a `skills/list` entry or a `skills/get` answer, never from the URI scheme, and the structural constraints (path ends in the skill name, explicit `SKILL.md`) apply to every scheme alike.
7. **Name-collision handling specified** ([`8b97c28`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2640/commits/8b97c28d25c09a0f5acb585d607243ec26d36c37)). A skill's `name` is a label, not an identifier — identity is the `uri`. Hosts MUST NOT assume name uniqueness, MUST disambiguate same-name entries within a listing rather than silently dropping or preferring one, and MUST resolve cross-origin collisions in per-origin namespaces (host-assigned server labels) with no silent shadowing in either direction, including of the host's own filesystem skills. Resolves the name-shadowing open item from June 30.
8. **Nested skills allowed, gated on fresh activation consent** ([`100c5a4`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2640/commits/100c5a40011fe4591a38a3eb3f4ac6d5d424d4c2)). From the enclosing skill's perspective, nested content is ordinary supporting content and a nested `SKILL.md` read that way is ordinary markdown; *activating* a nested skill as a skill in its own right requires fresh, explicit user consent — approval of the enclosing skill does not substitute. Publication stays flat.

Net protocol surface: two required methods (`skills/list`, and potentially `skills/get`) that every server declaring the extension implements, one optional method (`resources/directory/read`) behind a single feature flag, and no other new methods, message types, or schema changes.

**Rationale:** 

The scope-down trades breadth for a landable V1 version. Archives were the main source of review churn and their real need (bulk fetch) is preserved as an open follow-up (an optimized batch read, to be compared against archives as a separate resources-as-filesystem track). The June 30 discussion had sketched a "zero new methods" version; that was set aside during CM alignment because the index resource's format was itself a CM objection, and [SEP-2549] (Final for the upcoming release) gives list-shaped methods standardized caching for free — a method is first-class in the protocol where a reserved-URI convention is not. 

Keeping optionality to a single feature flag responds to the CM position that optionality within a bounded primitive produces capability matrices and unused features (the sampling/logging lesson). Making name-collision handling normative rather than implementation-defined responds to security findings that same-name skills are a live impersonation surface across harnesses that each break ties differently. Deferred, not rejected: archives, batch read, distribution via well-known URL, and dynamic tool loading remain candidate follow-on iterations, to be informed by implementation experience with this scope.
