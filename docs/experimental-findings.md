## VS Code: MCP-served skills as agent skills (Issue #66)

> Written against the pre-v1 draft (August 2026). The index format, `type: "skill-md"`, archive entries, and resource templates discussed below belong to that draft; v1 replaced the index with `skills/list`/`skills/get`, dropped archives and template entries (decision log, 2026-07-16), and makes digest verification a host MUST.

**Implementation:** [tobi-oye/vscode#1](https://github.com/tobi-oye/vscode/pull/1) — on a [microsoft/vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) fork (personal exploration, not submitted upstream)

Added `skill://` discovery to VS Code and verified it against the [Hugging Face MCP server](https://github.com/huggingface/hf-mcp-server) (`https://huggingface.co/mcp`). VS Code discovered 8 skills and offered them to the model with no manual attachment.

**Findings:**

- **VS Code already had the whole progressive-disclosure loop; it just had no MCP source.** `findAgentSkills()` → `name`/`description` into a `<skills>` block → a model-facing `skill` tool. Same shape as [skillsdotnet](https://github.com/PederHP/skillsdotnet)'s `SkillCatalog`. Only the MCP origin was missing.
- **The loading half needed no code.** `mcp-resource://` is already registered with VS Code's `IFileService`, so mapping `skill://…/SKILL.md` onto it is enough — the existing skill tool reads it and each read becomes a `resources/read`. "Treat filesystem and MCP skills identically" falls out for free.
- **The index wire format had already moved past the checked-in draft.** The live server serves `{url, digest, frontmatter:{name, description}}`; the draft here specifies top-level `name`/`description` and a required `type: "skill-md"`. A parser written to the draft matches **zero** entries on a real server. Accepting both shapes is three lines.
- **Per-context-computation discovery is an accidental DoS.** `findAgentSkills()` runs on every context rebuild; discovery is two round trips per server. A naive version issued 20 index reads for one chat turn. Same shape as the incident behind hf-mcp-server's client denylist ([#164](https://github.com/huggingface/hf-mcp-server/pull/164), ~100k req/min). Cache the *promise*, keyed on connection state — not just server id, or a lookup made while a server was stopped pins an empty result.
- **Cross-server name collisions are unspecified.** Skill names are a flat namespace. The SEP ties the final URI segment to the frontmatter `name` but says nothing about two servers both serving `deploy`. Local-over-MCP is defensible; MCP-vs-MCP degenerates to discovery order. **Worth an explicit note in the SEP.**
- **Provenance reaches the UI but not the model.** The `<skills>` block emits only `<name>`, `<description>`, `<file>` — and `<file>` encodes an opaque server id. Loading is never ambiguous, but a model reasoning across servers has no legible origin signal.
- **Archives cost 17 of 25 skills.** Archive-only entries have no `url` to a `SKILL.md`, so a resource-reading host skips them. Archives were removed from SEP-2640 (decision log, 2026-07-16); until servers follow, such hosts see a fraction of what is offered.
- **Adding a skill source touched four type surfaces** that must agree (storage enum, a parallel source union, an ext-host DTO, a proposed API type). Missing two produced a runtime throw that broke chat while `tsc` stayed green.
- **Identifying skills by URL alone was enough ([#54](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/experimental-ext-skills/issues/54)).** `skill://` prefix plus `/SKILL.md` suffix, no `_meta` read — a two-line filter with nothing to negotiate. Because the last path segment must match the skill name, the name is readable off the URL, so a picker fills without fetching every `SKILL.md`. The tradeoff is that a URL carries no structured metadata; tags, versions or provenance would still need `_meta`.
- **The index ships a `digest` that this client ignores.** The live server sends `sha256:` per entry; nothing here verifies it, so a corrupted or swapped skill loads silently. fast-agent does check it. Worth settling whether verification is the host's job — the draft currently leans on it being "the transport's concern over an authenticated MCP connection".

**Verification:** `tsc` clean; 10 unit tests (incl. `skill://` → `mcp-resource://` round trip and index parsing against verbatim live output); 112 existing promptSyntax tests pass; discovery confirmed against the live server.

**Note:** none of the three defects above were caught by type-checking or unit tests — all surfaced only from running against a real server.

**Open:**

- **Model invocation not demonstrated.** Discovery and contribution are confirmed; no run yet shows the model choosing to load an MCP-served skill. Confounded by source builds being unable to reach the Copilot service (OSS `product.json` ships no OAuth client config) and by a small auto-routed model. Consistent with the adherence problems recorded elsewhere on this page.
- Resource templates parsed but not materialized (need the completion API).
- No `resources/subscribe`, so mid-session skill updates are missed.

## McpGraph: Skills in MCP Server Repo

**Date:** Not documented

**Implementation:**

- **Repository:** [TeamSparkAI/mcpGraph](https://github.com/TeamSparkAI/mcpGraph)
- **Author:** Bob Dickinson
- **Relevant artifacts:** [mcpgraphtoolkit/SKILL.md](https://github.com/TeamSparkAI/mcpGraph/blob/main/skills/mcpgraphtoolkit/SKILL.md) (875+ lines)

**Approach tested:** Related to [Approach 5: Server Instructions Reference](approaches.md#5-server-instructions-reference). The standalone skill lives beside the MCP server but is not formally connected to it.

**Setup:**

- **Clients tested:** Claude; specific client not documented
- **Models tested:** Not documented
- **Configuration notes:** The skill teaches agents to build directed graphs of MCP nodes and orchestrate tool calls

**What was tested:** Whether an agent discovers and follows a colocated skill before attempting to use the server tools.

**Results:**

- **What worked:** Adding a server instruction that told the agent to read the skill before using the tool caused Claude to load it reliably
- **What didn't:** Claude initially ignored the skill even when the skill and server had similar descriptions, and only read it after failing to use the server tools
- **What was surprising:** A single server instruction changed the loading order reliably

**Requirements or design questions addressed:** Reliable skill discovery and loading, and whether server instructions can connect an MCP server to colocated skill guidance.

**Evidence and reproduction:** These are community-reported observations; the client version, model version, and runnable reproduction are not documented.

**Limitations:**

- This workaround works for 1:1 skill-to-server case, but doesn't solve discovery — users installing from a registry don't know to also install the skill
- Distinguishes between "skill required to make the server work at all" vs. "skill that orchestrates tools you could use without it" — potentially different solutions needed

## Skilljack MCP

**Repo:** [olaservo/skilljack-mcp](https://github.com/olaservo/skilljack-mcp)

Loads skills into tool descriptions. Uses dynamic tool updates to keep the skills manifest current.

Example eval approach and observations here: https://github.com/olaservo/skilljack-mcp/blob/main/evals/README.md

## FastMCP 3.0 Skills Support

**URL:** [gofastmcp.com/servers/providers/skills](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/providers/skills)

FastMCP added skills support in version 3.0. Worth examining for alignment with other approaches.

**Update model comparison (Feb 26 office hours):**

- FastMCP supports more of a "pull" model for updating resources that have changed
- The skills-as-resources implementation in this repo ([PR #16](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/experimental-ext-skills/pull/16)) watches for changes and allows clients to subscribe to resources via `resources/subscribe` and `resources/updated` notifications — more of a "push" model
- Both models are worth evaluating; the right choice is likely use-case specific

## PydanticAI Skills Support

**PR:** [pydantic/pydantic-ai#3780](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/pull/3780)

Introduces support for agent skills with a tools-based approach.

## NimbleBrain: skill:// Resource Consolidation

**Date:** Not documented

**Implementation:**

- **Repositories:** [mcp-ipinfo](https://github.com/NimbleBrainInc/mcp-ipinfo), [mcp-webfetch](https://github.com/NimbleBrainInc/mcp-webfetch), [mcp-pdfco](https://github.com/NimbleBrainInc/mcp-pdfco), [mcp-folk](https://github.com/NimbleBrainInc/mcp-folk), and [mcp-brave-search](https://github.com/NimbleBrainInc/mcp-brave-search)
- **Author:** [Mat Goldsborough](https://github.com/mgoldsborough) (NimbleBrain)
- **Relevant artifacts:** Atomic MCP server repositories with skills exposed as `skill://` resources

**Approach tested:** [Approach 3: Skills as Tools and/or Resources](approaches.md#3-skills-as-tools-andor-resources).

**Setup:**

- **Clients tested:** Not documented
- **Models tested:** Not documented
- **Configuration notes:** Previously separate MCP server code, skills, and `server.json` registry metadata were consolidated into one repository per server

**What was tested:** Whether colocating skills with their MCP servers and exposing them as resources simplifies distribution while preserving or improving agent results.

**Results:**

- **What worked:** Consolidating the artifacts simplified build, versioning, and deployment; skills ship atomically with the tools they describe
- **What worked:** `skill://` resources provided ephemeral availability without git cloning or client-side file-system access
- **What worked:** Quick tests produced the same or better results than injecting skills before the LLM call
- **What didn't:** Not documented
- **What was surprising:** Not documented

**Requirements or design questions addressed:** Installless skill availability, provenance through colocation, atomic versioning, and reuse of existing MCP resource primitives.

**Evidence and reproduction:** The linked repositories are reference implementations. The comparison with upstream skill injection was reported through community discussion; a test procedure and quantitative results are not documented.

**Limitations:** Client versions, model versions, test cases, and evaluation criteria are not documented, so the result cannot yet be reproduced precisely.

**Sources and attribution:**

> "Skills living as skill:// resources on the server itself was the natural endpoint of that consolidation. The skill context is colocated with the tools it describes, versioned together, shipped together." — [Mat Goldsborough](https://github.com/mgoldsborough) (NimbleBrain), via Discord

## Skill Reliability and Adherence

Multiple community members have independently reported that models do not reliably load or follow skill instructions, even when skills are preloaded in context. This is a cross-cutting behavioral problem, not specific to any single implementation approach.

**Findings:**

- Models appear to frequently ignore available skills, requiring hooks or repeated prompting to trigger skill loading
- Skill adherence appears to be "time-decaying" similar to other model instructions — models follow instructions initially but lose adherence as the context window grows and compaction occurs
- Behavior is model-specific: weaker models show lower success rates with lazy-loaded skills
- One effective workaround observed by Kryspin: wrapping skills in a subagent whose name or description mentions the skill topic
- Community desire for "skill autoloads" and "dynamic memory autoloads" as design patterns

**Community input:**

> "Even Opus 4.6 needs to be constantly bugged to load skills when they're preloaded in the context already. I actually have a hook that reminds it to load skills and it still just doesn't a lot of the time." — Luca (AWS), via Discord

> "I also have this problem with skills: they're useful… when used. Which isn't nearly often enough." — Jeremiah (FastMCP), via Discord

> "Skills are ephemeral and/or time decaying — it clicks once and then give it some time and they lose the plot." — Kryspin (qcompute), via Discord

> "I've seen lazy load skills with various degrees of success, actually looks like it might be model specific… [best pattern is] putting them in with a subagent that similarly named or mentions the topic in their description." — Kryspin (qcompute), via Discord

## PHP MCP SDK + Symfony AI Mate: Skills as `skill://` resources

> Written against the pre-v1 draft (June 2026). References to `skill://index.json`, `resource_templates/list`, and `mcp-resource-template` entries describe that draft; v1 replaced the index with `skills/list`/`skills/get` and dropped template entries (decision log, 2026-07-16).

**Server / SDK:** [modelcontextprotocol/php-sdk#372](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/php-sdk/pull/372) — adds `io.modelcontextprotocol/skills` support to the official PHP MCP SDK
**Consumer:** [symfony/ai#2132](https://github.com/symfony/ai/pull/2132) — ships Agent Skills in the Symfony AI "Mate" MCP server
**Contributor:** Johannes Wachter ([@wachterjohannes](https://github.com/wachterjohannes))

First PHP-ecosystem implementation of SEP-2640 (prior documented implementations are
Python/TS). The SDK PR adds a one-line server affordance — `addSkillsFromDirectory()` —
that walks a directory, registers each `SKILL.md` and its supporting files as `skill://`
resources, derives `name`/`description` from YAML frontmatter, enforces the spec's
final-path-segment ↔ frontmatter-`name` rule, guards against path traversal, and serves
a `skill://index.json` discovery index. The Mate PR ships two real skills colocated with
the tools they orchestrate, including a multi-file skill with a `references/` subdirectory.

**Tested (works):**

- Serving is covered by MCP Inspector **stdio snapshot tests**: `resources/list`,
  `resources/read` of a `SKILL.md`, of a supporting file, and of `skill://index.json`,
  plus `resource_templates/list`. Unit tests cover frontmatter parsing (BOM/CRLF,
  non-mapping rejection), the name↔segment rule, and resource-name sanitization. PHPStan
  level 6 and the full suite (792 tests) green.
- The **directory model + relative supporting-file URIs** resolve correctly in a
  non-Python implementation — e.g. `skill://code-review/references/SECURITY.md` is a
  sibling resource of `skill://code-review/SKILL.md`. Positive evidence the directory
  model travels across ecosystems.

**`_meta` prefix — independent convergence (not a gap).** Our SDK independently chose
`io.modelcontextprotocol.skills/` to namespace extra frontmatter fields on the resource
descriptor — which matches the prefix SEP-2640 recommends ("When `_meta` keys are used for
skill resources, implementations SHOULD use the `io.modelcontextprotocol.skills/`
reverse-domain prefix"). Useful corroboration of the recommended prefix. Note: the
working-group repo-local draft ([`docs/sep-draft-skills-extension.md`](sep-draft-skills-extension.md))
does not yet include that sentence — its `_meta` paragraph ends at "…via the resource's
`_meta` object." — so the SEP PR and this repo's copy have drifted and could be synced.
(Discussed on [SEP-2640](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2640#issuecomment-4622668503).)

**SDK implementation notes (not spec gaps):**

- **Resource-name uniqueness, not charset.** The skill `name` charset (`[a-z0-9-]`, ≤64, no
  leading/trailing hyphen) is a strict subset of the MCP resource-name charset, so the
  SKILL.md resource `name` can carry the frontmatter `name` directly — "resource `name`
  SHOULD equal frontmatter `name`" is satisfiable. The wrinkle is uniqueness: our SDK
  registers every resource under a unique name key, including a skill's **supporting files**
  (`references/SECURITY.md`) and skills that **share a frontmatter `name` under different
  prefixes** (`acme/billing/refunds` vs `acme/support/refunds`). So we derive a unique name
  from the URI path and keep the frontmatter `name` in `title`. Identity is the URI
  regardless — an SDK registration detail, not a SEP issue.
- **Empty-payload capability serialization trap.** An extension advertising an empty `{}`
  payload (as Skills does) serialized to `[]` rather than `{}` and had to be coerced. A
  likely footgun for any SDK implementing an empty-payload extension.
- **`symfony/yaml` required** for frontmatter parsing — the feature is non-functional
  without a YAML parser; frontmatter handling is a real dependency, not free.

**Client consumption (observed from docs, not yet eval'd):**

- Per current **Claude Code** documentation (June 2026), Claude Code loads skills from the
  filesystem and plugins only; it does not discover or load MCP-served `skill://` resources
  as skills, and its MCP resource support is **user-`@`-mention attachments, not
  model-driven `resources/read`**. So end-to-end, model-driven consumption of MCP-served
  skills is not exercisable in Claude Code today — a data point for
  [#38](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/experimental-ext-skills/issues/38).
- **FastMCP 3.0** (per this repo's existing findings) is the consumer best positioned to
  validate the serving half against; not yet done.

**Remaining / untested:**

- No model-adherence eval yet comparing filesystem vs. `skill://` delivery.
- `mcp-resource-template` skill type (parameterized namespaces) is deferred in the SDK PR —
  the `SkillType` enum carries the value for forward-compat, but only `skill-md` entries are
  emitted; the template path is unimplemented and untested.
- Not yet tested against any client that implements model-driven `skill://` loading.
